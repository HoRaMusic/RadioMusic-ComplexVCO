THis is a work in progress, a lot can be improved in the code but all seems to be working.

Due to some hardware limitations the pitch CV input can received 3.3V and then the input range is 3.3 octaves.

The frequency pot is locked about 1 sec after turning this to avoid pitch unstablity caused by
the teensy adc unstability.
